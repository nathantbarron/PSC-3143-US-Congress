    "text": "Course Objectives\nThis course examines the politics of the U.S. Congress. Successful students will demonstrate an analytic understanding of the historical development of Congress, representation and the interplay between candidates and voters in congressional elections, the evolution and significance of rules and procedures governing deliberation, the organizational rationales underlying the committee system, and the role of political parties and their leaders. The underlying theme of the course and the theoretical lens through which students will investigate congressional organization and the behavior of its members is also the basis of most contemporary research on legislative politics—the assumption that political elites act strategically in pursuing their goals. Each section of the course will emphasize this perspective and students will learn to draw out its implications for making sense of Congress while applying the basic tools of social science methodology."

    "text": "Course Evaluation\n\nGrades\nThe grade for the course will be based on three components: Midterm and Final Exams, Assignments, and Reading Assessments. Each assignment will be graded, with scores posted on Canvas. Grades are assigned on a 10-point scale: A=90-100, B=80-90, C=70-80, D=60-70, F=0-60. There are no additional opportunities for extra credit, so please know what grade you “need” and work toward it over the course of the semester.\n\n\n\nComponent\nPercent of Final Grade\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nMidterm 1\n15%\nSept. 24\n\n\nMidterm 2\n15%\nOct. 31\n\n\nFinal Exam\n25%\nDec. 10\n\n\nShort Assignments\n25%\nvaries\n\n\nReading Assessments\n20%\nweekly\n\n\n\n\n\nMidterm and Final Exams\nTwo midterm exams (15% each) and a final exam (25%) will be administered for the course. The exams will assess mastery of the major themes covered in readings, lecture, discussion, and other course assignments. A study guide will be posted the week prior to each exam.\nMake-up exams will not be permitted. The instructor may grant an early midterm exam date on a case-by-case basis. There are no make-up or early exam dates for the final exam.\n\n\nShort Assignments\nThere will be a total of 10 short assignments over the course of the semester (2.5% each). These assignments are designed to provide opportunities for extending core concepts.\nLate submissions will be penalized 11 points at the beginning of every 24-hour period after the deadline. For example, an assignment due at 5:00pm on a Friday and submitted at 5:01pm on the following day will receive a 22-point penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere will be one opportunity for “extra credit.” Students who attend the Josh Lee Lecture with Julian Zelizer will have their lowest short assignment grade dropped. The Lecture will take place on Wednesday, October 9, from 3:00-4:00pm in Gaylord Hall, Room 1140.\n\n\n\n\nReading Assessments\nReading the textbook and accompanying reading is essential to success in this course. Accordingly, students will be required to complete short reading assessments on Canvas each week. The lowest two assessment scores will be dropped; therefore, there will be absolutely no make-up quizzes."

I am happy to meet with anyone that might have questions about course material, assignments, or other course-related issues If you are unable to meet during this time, please do not hesitate to set up an appointment by email (nathanbarron@ou.edu).\n\n\nRegrading Policy\nIf you feel there has been an error in the grading of one your assignment, you may request (in writing) a regrade of the assignment. Please send me your request in an email. I will regrade the entire assignment, not just the part you are disputing. Therefore, your regrade might increase or decrease the overall grade on the assignment.\n\n\nAcademic Dishonesty\nCheating is strictly prohibited at the University of Oklahoma, because it devalues the degree you are working hard to get. As a member of the OU community it is your responsibility to protect your educational investment by knowing and following the rules. For specific definitions on what constitutes cheating, review the Student’s Guide to Academic Integrity at integrity.ou.edu.\n\n\nGenerative AI\nWhile learning to use generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is an emerging skill, the use of such programs (e.g. ChatGPT) is strongly discouraged for this course. Students should be informed that the material generated by these programs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise problematic. As such, the reliance on GAI can contradict the academic goals of exercising rigor, engaging critically, and pursuing knowledge.\nIf you include material generated by an AI program, it should be cited like any other reference material (with due consideration for the quality of the reference, which may be poor). Any plagiarism or other form of cheating will be dealt with severely under relevant University policies. Of course, there are many cases where I may not be able to tell if you cheated or not. Note however that, for any reason, including doubts about whether the paper was written with external help, any student can be required to come in for an oral examination on their assignment. In such a case, a grade for the oral examination will replace that for the paper."

If you have already established reasonable accommodations with the Accessibility and Disability Resource Center (ADRC), please submit your semester accommodation request through the ADRC as soon as possible and contact me privately, so that we have adequate time to arrange your approved academic accommodations.\nIf you have not yet established services through ADRC, but have a documented disability and require accommodations, please complete ADRC’s pre-registration form to begin the registration process. ADRC facilitates the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations for students at OU. For more information on ADRC registration procedures, please review their Register with the ADRC web page. You may also contact them at (405)325-3852 or adrc@ou.edu, or visit www.ou.edu/adrc for more information.\nNote: disabilities may include, but are not limited to, mental health, chronic health, physical, vision, hearing, learning and attention disabilities, pregnancy-related. ADRC can also support students experiencing temporary medical conditions.\n\n\nTitle IX Resources and Reporting Requirement\nThe University of Oklahoma faculty are committed to creating a safe learning environment for all members of our community, free from gender and sex-based discrimination, including sexual harassment, domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, in accordance with Title IX. There are resources available to those impacted, including: speaking with someone confidentially about your options, medical attention, counseling, reporting, academic support, and safety plans. If you have (or someone you know has) experienced any form of sex or gender-based discrimination or violence and wish to speak with someone confidentially, please contact OU Advocates (available 24/7 at 405-615-0013) or University Counseling Center (M-F 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 405-325-2911).\nBecause the University of Oklahoma is committed to the safety of you and other students, and because of our Title IX obligations, I, as well as other faculty, Graduate Assistants, and Teaching Assistants, are mandatory reporters. This means that we are obligated to report gender-based violence that has been disclosed to us to the Institutional Equity Office. This means that we are obligated to report gender-based violence that has been disclosed to us to the Institutional Equity Office. This includes disclosures that occur in: class discussion, writing assignments, discussion boards, emails and during Student/Office Hours. You may also choose to report directly to the Institutional Equity Office. After a report is filed, the Title IX Coordinator will reach out to provide resources, support, and information and the reported information will remain private. For more information regarding the University’s Title IX Grievance procedures, reporting, or support measures, please visit Institutional Equity Office at 405-325-3546.\n\n\nAdjustments for Pregnancy / Childbirth Related Issues\nShould you need modifications or adjustments to your course requirements because of documented pregnancy-related or childbirth-related issues, please contact the Accessibility and Disability Resource Center at 405/325-3852 and/or the Institutional Equity Office at 405/325-3546 as soon as possible. Also, see the Institutional Equity Office FAQ section on Pregnant and Parenting Students’ Rights for answers to commonly asked questions.\n\n\nMental Health\nSupport is available for any student experiencing mental health issues that are impacting their academic success. Students can either been seen at the University Counseling Center (UCC) located on the second floor of Goddard Health Center or receive 24/7/365 crisis support from a licensed mental health provider through TELUS Health. To schedule an appointment or receive more information about mental health resources at OU please call the UCC at 405-325-2911 or visit University Counseling Center. The UCC is located at 620 Elm Ave., Room 201, Norman, OK 73019.\n\n\nFinal Exam Preparation Period\nPre-finals week will be defined as the seven calendar days before the first day of finals. Faculty may cover new course material throughout this week. For specific provisions of the policy please refer to OU’s Final Exam Preparation Period policy.\n\n\nEmergency Protocol\nDuring an emergency, there are official university procedures that will maximize your safety.\nSevere Weather: If you receive an OU Alert to seek refuge or hear a tornado siren that signals severe weather.\n\nLook for severe weather refuge location maps located inside most OU buildings near the entrances.\nSeek refuge inside a building. Do not leave one building to seek shelter in another building that you deem safer. If outside, get into the nearest building.\nGo to the building’s severe weather refuge location. If you do not know where that is, go to the lowest level possible and seek refuge in an innermost room. Avoid outside doors and windows.\nGet in, Get Down, Cover Up\nWait for official notice to resume normal activities.\n\nAdditional Weather Safety Information is available through the Department of Campus Safety.\n\n\nActive Threat Guidance\nThe University of Oklahoma embraces a Run, Hide, Fight strategy for active threats on campus. This strategy is well known, widely accepted, and proven to save lives. To receive emergency campus alerts, be sure to update your contact information and preferences in the account settings section at one.ou.edu.\nRUN: Running away from the threat is usually the best option. If it is safe to run, run as far away from the threat as possible. Call 911 when you are in a safe location and let them know from which OU campus you’re calling from and location of active threat.\nHIDE: If running is not practical, the next best option is to hide. Lock and barricade all doors; turn of all lights; turn down your phone’s volume; search for improvised weapons; hide behind solid objects and walls; and hide yourself completely and stay quiet. Remain in place until law enforcement arrives. Be patient and remain hidden.\nFIGHT: If you are unable to run or hide, the last best option is to fight. Have one or more improvised weapons with you and be prepared to attack. Attack them when they are least expecting it and hit them where it hurts most: the face (specifically eyes, nose, and ears), the throat, the diaphragm (solar plexus), and the groin.\nPlease save OUPD’s contact information in your phone.\nNORMAN campus: For non-emergencies call (405) 325-1717. For emergencies call (405) 325-1911 or dial 911.\n\n\nFire Alarm/General Emergency\nIf you receive an OU Alert that there is danger inside or near the building, or the fire alarm inside the building activates:\n\nLEAVE the building. Do not use the elevators.\nKNOW at least two building exits\nASSIST those that may need help\nPROCEED to the emergency assembly area\nONCE safely outside, NOTIFY first responders of anyone that may still be inside building due to mobility issues.\nWAIT for official notice before attempting to re-enter the building.\n\nOU Fire Safety on Campus"

Using information from the course and any outside sources (if desired, not required), briefly discuss the relative merits and limitations of his arguments in contemporary electoral politics.

Finally, conclude by explaining whether you agree or disagree with Mayhew that MCs’ being “single-minded seekers of reelection” is good for democracy.\n\n\n\n\nYou should respond to the questions above with your own insights and voice. For that reason, you should refrain from providing direct quotes except where absolutely necessary; in those cases, you should attempt to include a minimal quote that enhances the effectiveness of your response.\nIn all cases, you should include references to page numbers when you rely on specific information, whether using a direct quote or a paraphrase. Because this assignment only covers a single source, you are permitted to only use page numbers for in-text references.

    "text": "You have two alternative options for this assignment. The first option is to create two separate maps: one map that balances population across districts and one map that is targeted for partisan gain. Minimal writing is involved in this option. The second option is to create one map that balances population across districts and to respond to paragraph-length reflection questions about the analysis of their map.\nFor either option, you’ll need create and export maps from davesredistricting.org. Please complete the following steps:\n\nNavigate to davesredistricting.org.\nIn the upper right hand corner of the screen, click “SIGN UP.” On the next screen, choose a username and password for your account.\nAfter creating your account and making sure you are logged into the account, you should be directed toward a page that says “My Maps” in the upper left-hand corner. If not, click the menu button in the upper left-hand corner of the webpage and select “Maps;” this should direct you to an empty “My Maps” folder.\nIn “My Maps”, you should select “+ New Map” in the upper right-hand corner. In the popup menu, be sure to give your map a name and to select “NC” as the state. You can change the color palette if you prefer, but no other options need to be changed.\nFor help on how to use the redistricting tool, you can find a library of articles at Dave’s Redistricting Medium page.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a districting plan that aims to make each district equal in population size. For North Carolina, each district should be as close as possible to 745,671. Be sure that you are also paying attention to the other basic rules of redistricting: all precincts should be assigned to a district, districts should be continuous, and districts should not create “holes” (i.e., no district should be completely surrounded by another like a donut and donut hole).\nCreate a second districting plan that aims to acheive one of the following goals, while adhering to the basic rules of redistricting:\n\n\nRepublican advantage\nDemocratic advantage\nCompetitiveness\n\n\nIn a word document, answer the following questions:\n\n\nFor your first map, how many seats were expected to be won by Democrats? Republicans? How many districts were competitive (i.e. majority party is less than 53% of the popular vote)?\nWhich goal did you select for your second map? How many seats were expected to be won by Democrats? Republicans? How many districts were competitive (i.e. majority party is less than 53% of the popular vote)?\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a districting plan that aims to make each district equal in population size.

Republicans? How many districts were competitive (i.e. majority party is less than 53% of the popular vote)?\nUsing the Analytics tool, how did your map perform on the metrics of proportionality, competitiveness, splitting, minority representation, and compactness?

For this assignment, you are expected to complete your own roll call voting record across a range of political questions. In class, we will explore how these voting decisions are then mapped into ideological space using W-NOMINATE.\n\n\nYou can access the questionnaire here: Questionnaire (.xlsx). These questions are selected from ISideWith.com. Before you begin, please choose a 3-letter identifier that will be attached to the results distributed in class (e.g. “NTB”).1 The identifier should be placed in the first cell of the “id” column (i.e. replace “AAA” with your own id).\nYou can then proceed through the questionnaire, recording a 1 if your answer is yes or a 0 if your answer is no. You will likely encounter several questions where neither 1 nor 0 are totally appropriate – that’s normal. Legislators face the same challenges when required to vote Yea or Nay on complex legislation. Just pick the response that is most representative of your view. Once finished, you should save the file as an Excel file (.xlsx).\n\n\n\nGrading of this assignment will be based on completion. The content of responses is neither individually reviewed nor considered in grading.\n\n\n\nAs stated in the syllabus, the University of Oklahoma does not discriminate or permit discrimination by any member of its community against any individual based on the individual’s political beliefs.\nAny student may request an alternative assignment from the instructor no later than Wednesday, September 25th, at 10:00am CT.
